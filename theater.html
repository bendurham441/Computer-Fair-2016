        <div id="announce-body" style="height: 700px;">
          <p class="description" style="padding: 0px">The SMS Drama Club is an audition-based group that performs once a year during the spring. Auditions take place in the fall and consist of both singing and acting trials. Between the auditions and the show, the club rigorously practices after school. This spring, the club performed the show <i>Into the Woods Junior</i>. Students are not only able to act, but also run almost all of the behind the scenes. Behind the scenes jobs include runners, microphone managers, soundboard operator, light board operators, and spotlight operators. The SMS Drama Club prepares students for the even more rigorous theater program offered at Springfield Township High School.</p>
